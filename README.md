# ROLauncher
Launcher for Revelation Online NA/EU. This lets you start the game without needing to go through My.com Game Center.

# Features
* Auto-start the game after *n* seconds after you log in (you can edit this value in the `ROLauncher.exe.config` file under the `AutoLaunchDelayInSeconds` setting, the default is 5 seconds)
* Saves your credentials securely (your password is never saved anywhere after you log in for the first time)
* Notifies you if there is a new game update available, and gives you the option to start My.com Game Center to initiate it (this can be disabled with the `ROLauncher.exe.config` file under the `CheckForROUpdates` setting)
